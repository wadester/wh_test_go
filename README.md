WH Test Go Repository -- GO test files

Summary:
========

This is a simple repository with multiple sample GO programs.  These are 
simple programs that may be used as examples for writing GO programs.  
This project may be public, but it does not yet serve any specific purpose.  
It may in the future....  At this point it includes a bunch of sample 
GO programs, some based on GO examples.

History:
========

1) 0.1   9/28/2015    created

2) 0.2   10/26/2015   updated with some links and cleanups

Notes:
======

1)  This document is in a parsable format similar to asciidoc.  I have used
    this format for MANY years (I may upload a tool or migrate to asciidoc).

2)  This project is mainly to experiment with github and with GO.  It is
    loosely based on my wh_test_py github repository.

3)  License for ALL files is GPL, see LICENSE.

4)  Please e-mail me with any updates, suggestions, etc.

5)  Programs include TBD.

6)  After running the programs, run cleanup to remove test files (e.g., sqlite).

7)  If errors like cannot find package "runtime", you may need to unset
    the GO_ROOT (I had it setup for a custom build then switched to 
    the golang-go Ubuntu package).
